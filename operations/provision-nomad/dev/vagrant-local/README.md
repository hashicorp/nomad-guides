## Challenge

There are many different ways to provision and configure an easily accessible development Nomad cluster, making it difficult to get started.

## Solution

Provision a development Nomad cluster in Vagrant.

The Vagrant Development Nomad guide is for **educational purposes only**. It's designed to allow you to quickly standup a single instance with Nomad running in `-dev` mode. The single node is provisioned into a local VM, allowing for easy access to the instance. Because Nomad is running in `-dev` mode, all data is in-memory and not persisted to disk. If any agent fails or the node restarts, all data will be lost. This is only mean for local use.

## Prerequisites

- [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [Download Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Steps

We will now provision the development Nomad cluster in Vagrant.

### Step 1: Start Vagrant

Run `vagrant up` to start the VM and configure Nomad. That's it! Once provisioned, view the Vagrant ouput for next steps.

#### CLI

[`vagrant up` Command](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html)

##### Request

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

##### Response
```
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've provisioned and configured a development Nomad cluster, start walking through the [Nomad Guides](https://www.nomadproject.io/guides/index.html).
