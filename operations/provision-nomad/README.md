# Provision Nomad

The goal of this guide is to allows users to easily provision a Nomad cluster in just a few short commands.

## Reference Material

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
- [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)

## Estimated Time to Complete

5 minutes.

## Personas

### Operator

The operator is responsible for producing the Nomad cluster infrastructure and managing day 1 & 2 operations. This includes initial service administration, upgrades, logging/monitoring, and more.

### Developer

The developer will be consuming the Nomad services and developing against it. This may be leveraging Nomad for mananging Application Deployment, Multi-Cloud applications, or Flexible Workloads.

### InfoSec

Infosec will be creating and managing ACLs for Nomad, this may include both ACLs and Sentinel policies.

## Challenge

There are many different ways to provision and configure a Nomad cluster, making it difficult to get started.

## Solution

Provision a Nomad cluster. This will enable users to easily provision a Nomad cluster for their desired use case.

### Dev

The [Nomad Dev Guides](./dev) are for **educational purposes only**. They're designed to allow you to quickly standup a single instance with Nomad running in `-dev` mode in your desired provider. The single node is provisioned into a single public subnet that's completely open, allowing for easy (and insecure) access to the instance. Because Nomad is running in `-dev` mode, all data is in-memory and not persisted to disk. If any agent fails or the node restarts, all data will be lost. This is in no way, shape, or form meant for Production use, please use with caution.

### Quick Start

The [Nomad Quick Start Guide](./quick-start) provisions a 3 node Nomad server cluster, a 3 node Consul cluster, and a 1 node Nomad client cluster in the provider of your choice.

The Quick Start guide leverages the scripts in the [Guides Configuration Repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/guides-configuration) to do runtime configuration of Nomad. Although using `curl bash` at runtime is _not_ best practices, this makes it quick and easy to standup a Nomad cluster with no external dependencies like pre-built images. This guide will also forgo setting up TLS/encryption on Nomad for the sake of simplicity.

### Best Practices

The [Nomad Best Practices Guide](./best-practices) provisions a 3 node Nomad cluster with a similar architecture to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide in the provider of your choice. The difference is this guide will setup TLS/encryption across Nomad and depends on pre-built images rather than runtime configuration. You can find the Packer templates to create these Nomad images in the [Guides Configuration Repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/guides-configuration/tree/master/vault).

## Steps

We will now provision the Nomad cluster.

### Step 1: Choose your Preferred Guide

`cd` into one of the below guides from the root of the repository and follow the instructions from there.

- [Vagrant dev](./dev/vagrant-local)
- [AWS dev](./dev/terraform-aws)
- [AWS quick-start](./quick-start/terraform-aws)
- [AWS best-practices](./best-practices/terraform-aws)

#### CLI

```sh
$ cd operations/provision-nomad/dev/vagrant-local
$ cd operations/provision-nomad/dev/terraform-aws
$ cd operations/provision-nomad/quick-start/terraform-aws
$ cd operations/provision-nomad/best-practices/terraform-aws
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've provisioned and configured Nomad, start walking through the [Nomad Guides](https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/index.html).
